Neurons:
	It contains of set weights and Inputs.
	Then , caluculate sum of (wights* inputs)+ Bias
	Then, it will send to activation functions.
	Finally  the activation function return the neurons output.

Neural Network :
	It contains three network :
		Input Layers
		Hidden Layers
		Output Layers
	Neurons is used to minimize the error.
	Way of adjust the weight and bias.
	If the network contains more then 2 Layers, it is called Deep neural network.
