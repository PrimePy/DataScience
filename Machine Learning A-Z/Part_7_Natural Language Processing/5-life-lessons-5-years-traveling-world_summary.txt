SUMMARY : 5-LIFE-LESSONS-5-YEARS-TRAVELING-WORLDworld travel gives you greater perspective on life, but it limits your ability to commit to thingsthe beauty of traveling around the world is that it allows you to get altitude.no, i don’t mean airplane altitude.i mean it allows you to get a big-picture perspective on things, to see the various ways cultures mesh and collide with one another and how the different streams of history have eroded and hardened each country’s social structures into their respective places.you realize that much of what you believed to be unique in your home country is often universal, and that much of what you thought was universal is often specific to your home country.you realize that humans are by and large the same, with the same needs, the same desires and the same awful biases that pit them haplessly against each other.you realize that no matter how much you see or how much you learn about the world, there’s always more — that with every new destination discovered, you become aware of a dozen others, and with every new piece of knowledge obtained, you only become more aware of how much you really don’t know.you realize that you will never be able to explore or encounter all of these destinations.the vast majority of the planet doesn’t care what you say or do — this is a good thingwhen everything is familiar — when we wake up in the same home, get coffee at the same cafe, drive on the same roads, say hello to the same people, shop at the same stores, eat lunch at the same restaurants, and crap in the same bathrooms — we get an unrealistic impression that all of the little things matter.if you say something dumb at the cash register, well crap, you buy muffins from this place every morning — now you’re going to look like an idiot every time you come back.or if you accidentally piss off a co-worker, you have to worry that you see them every day, and it’s going to be awkward, and then the awkwardness will make them hate you even more, which will just make it more awkward, which will then probably make you say something even stupider and then they’ll get even more offended and then it will be even more horrible, and oh my god, i just want to stay in bed and play video games forever.but when you’re abroad, you can’t help but embarrass yourself constantly — whether it’s stuttering through an unknown language, ordering something disgusting and almost vomiting all over the tablecloth, or just saying really stupid things in a moment of confusion.and the beautiful thing is, you soon realize that nobody cares.the more you travel, the more you lose sight of who you are — this is also a good thingmany people embark on journeys around the world in order to “find themselves.” in fact, it’s sort of cliché, the type of thing that sounds deep and important but doesn’t actually mean anything.whenever somebody claims they want to travel to “find themselves,” this is what i think they mean: they want to remove all of the major external influences from their lives, put themselves into a random and neutral environment, and then see what person they turn out to be.by removing their external influences — the overbearing boss at work, the nagging mother, the pressure of a few unsavory friends — they’re then able to see how they actually feel about their life back home.so perhaps a better way to put it is that you don’t travel to “find yourself,” you travel in order to get a more accurate perception of who you were back home, and whether you actually like that person or not.but here’s the problem: travel is yet another external influence.the person you are on a beach in cuba is not the person you are sitting in the cubicle in the middle of butt ass winter in chicago.
